#step1 upload your web files
mkdir /var/www/html/example #then upload web files at this dir
#if the index page is index.html, you can now open the page in the web explorer by type url:http://youipadress/example
#By this way, you don't need to do any config work, it's done here!
#if you want visit the website by domine/host name, or by port, go on next
#by this way, we can put the website file at other dir, we will use /var/www/example at follow steps

#step2 create a config file
touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/example
#paste content like this:
#server {
#       listen 80;
#       listen [::]:80;
#
#       server_name example.com;
#
#       root /var/www/example;
#       index index.html;
#
#       location / {
#               try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
#       }
#}


#step3 edit the file
#visited by domine, change the servernane for yours
#visited by port(usually in local area networkï¼Œ multi websites), chang the file like this:
#server {
#       listen yourport;
#       #listen [::]:80;
#
#       server_name IP_ADRESS;
#
#       root /var/www/example;
#       index index.html;
#
#       location / {
#               try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
#       }


#step4 php webpages surport
#edit the config file like this
#    server {
#    listen 80;
#    listen [::]:80;

#    server_name example.com;
#
#    root   /var/www/example.com;
#    index  index.html index.php;
#
#    location / {
#        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
#    }
#    location ~ \.php$ {
#            include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
#            include fastcgi_params;
#            fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
#            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/example$fastcgi_script_name;
